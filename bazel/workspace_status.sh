# Bazel treats as constant metadata: an action that embeds one is not
# invalidated when it changes, so a cached action can keep publishing a stale
# value. Everything below identifies a commit and must invalidate when the
# commit changes, so none of it belongs there. Nothing is lost to caching --
# these values change only with the commit, which changes the build anyway.
